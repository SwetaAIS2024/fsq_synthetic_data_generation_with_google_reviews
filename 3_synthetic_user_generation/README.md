# Synthetic User Generation

This folder contains scripts and documentation for generating synthetic users and their check-in histories to enrich the Foursquare dataset.

### 3. Synthetic User Generation

**Theory & Basis:**  
Synthetic users are generated by sampling from the statistical distribution of real user behaviors (e.g., visit frequency, POI preferences). This increases the diversity and density of the dataset.

**Proof for Use Case:**  
- Analyze real user behavior distributions (e.g., histogram of check-ins per user).
- Generate synthetic users with similar patterns.
- Compare aggregate statistics (e.g., user activity distribution, POI popularity) before and after.
